## My learning sources
  I have **purchased** below courses from **Udemy**.

Studied AWS CSAA course from Udemy taught by **Ryan Kroonenburg** from [A cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) team.
* [Udemy | AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2019](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

## About the course
   A cloud Guru course via Udemy is huge and in order to explain to you the basic concepts, All the concepts are nicely explained. Few topics were explained in more detail then needed, But it is always good to know more when learning. I'll do my best to include every thing in my notes.
   
   #### What these notes are not
   These notes are not a substitution of the course, you MUST go through the course to be able to pass the exam, it's just a place where you can revise and have all the notes at one location.

## My study path

* Watched one topic at the time. Doing revision of the notes for things I keep forgetting.
* Finished Practice test from Neal Davis.
* Finished Practice test from Jon Bonso.
* Do as many tests as you can and revise what you don't know.
